# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

Correctness and hardening pass over the deterministic engine. Every fix below
ships with a regression test that fails on the previous code, and each is a
number or a behaviour a real file could have hit — the engine version moves to
`1.4.0` and the payload version to `2.11` because an analysis saved before this
work and one saved after it can legitimately disagree.

### Security

- Refresh compatible dependency versions to resolve multipart, XML parsing, and test-tool advisories. The dependency audit reports no remaining vulnerabilities.

### Added

- Evidence review in the workspace: search claims, columns and methods; filter by strength; and select findings for a focused, downloadable HTML brief. The brief carries sample size, coverage, methods, caveats, calculation records and the source reading. Analyst notes remain separate from computed evidence and stay in the browser tab until export.

### Fixed

- **Correlations over large-magnitude columns.** Pearson was computed with the
  `n·Σx² − (Σx)²` shortcut, which subtracts two enormous, nearly equal numbers.
  On any column whose values dwarf their own spread — epoch milliseconds,
  account numbers, amounts in minor units — the variance cancelled away
  entirely, in three different directions: a denominator of exactly 0, read as
  "constant series" and dropped, so a perfect relationship never appeared at
  all; a negative radicand, so `Math.sqrt` returned `NaN`, which compares false
  against every threshold and reached the results as a coefficient of `null`;
  or a surviving but wrong magnitude (0.707 where the answer was 1). Pearson is
  now computed from centred deviations, the roots are multiplied after being
  taken so large squared deviations cannot overflow to `Infinity`, and the
  ratio is clamped so rounding cannot carry an exact 1 past the boundary.

- **A JSON array containing `null` returned a 500.** `[{"a":1}, null, {"a":2}]`
  is a valid file, and a null element reaches the analytics layer as a row of
  `null`. Every module reads cells as `row?.[column]` and counts such a row as
  one whose values are all missing — except the quality profiler, which reached
  in directly and threw. It now reads cells the same way as its siblings, so the
  profile and the statistics agree on how much of a column is present.

- **Excel's UTF-8 CSV export lost its first column.** A leading byte-order mark
  became the first character of the first column's name, so the parsed key was
  `﻿id` while the header on screen read `id` — and naming that column as a
  target or in a column selection came back as `unknown_column`, a 400 on a name
  copied off the reader's own file. A `.json` file starting with a mark did not
  parse at all, because `JSON.parse` rejects one outright. Decoding now honours
  the mark, and UTF-16 (Excel's "Unicode Text" export) is decoded rather than
  read as UTF-8 mojibake.

- **A currency column was two different types on one screen.** `values.js` has
  read `$48,000`, `12.5%` and `(1,200)` as numbers since 1.3.0, but the quality
  profiler still used bare `Number()`. The statistics panel reported a mean while
  the quality panel labelled the column "text"; a column where only some cells
  carried a thousands separator split across two types and was reported as a
  high-severity *"mixes value types"* issue against a column holding nothing but
  numbers; and the outlier count, gated on the profiled type, never ran on such
  a column at all.

- **Dates were read in whichever frame JavaScript happened to pick.**
  `2024-03-01` parses as UTC midnight while `03/01/2024`, `Jan 5, 2024` and
  `2024-03-01 00:30` parse as midnight in the *host's* zone, and everything
  downstream formats with `toISOString()`. Measured at UTC+04:00, a column of
  `03/01/2024`–`03/06/2024` reported `earliest: 2024-02-29`, with every period
  bucket, gap and evidence claim shifted with it; the same file read correctly
  under `TZ=UTC`. Vercel runs UTC and never saw it — a self-hosted deployment
  anywhere else did. Every naive shape now lands in one frame; a value carrying
  an explicit `Z` or offset is an absolute instant and is left alone.

- **Statistics below the fourth decimal were rounded to zero.** `toFixed` counts
  decimal places, not significant digits, so a column of rates, ppm
  concentrations, probabilities or p-values reported mean 0, median 0, std 0,
  every quantile 0, a confidence interval of `[0, 0]`, and a histogram whose
  every bin ran from 0 to 0 — printed beside a min and max that were never
  rounded and so still showed the real values. `min` and `max` are now rounded
  like their siblings too, which also stops float noise such as
  `max: 0.8759999999999999` appearing next to `mean: 0.876`.

- **A weak finding could outrank a strong one.** `period_volume_trend` carries a
  word rather than a number, and `Math.abs("increasing")` is `NaN`; the `||`
  chain read that as "no opinion" and fell through to comparing claim text,
  which made the ranking comparator non-transitive. With one such item present,
  a |0.9| finding and a |0.1| finding could each be ranked above the other
  depending only on the order they were built in. That decides the headline
  order and, past the evidence cap, which findings survive at all.

- **A header-row correction the file could not honour vanished.** An
  out-of-range `headerRow` silently became "no override", and the report then
  read `headerSource: "detected"` with an empty `unapplied` list — identical to
  a request that was never sent. It is now reported like any other correction
  that did not apply, which also makes the reading `uncertain`.

- **PDFs were written to disk and parsed without a bound.** Every upload went to
  `os.tmpdir()` and was unlinked inside two event handlers, so a parser that
  neither errored nor completed left the file behind — and a warm serverless
  instance keeps `/tmp` between invocations, making repeated malformed PDFs a
  slow disk-exhaustion path. Such a parse also hung the request until the
  platform killed the function, which returns no status, message or request id
  at all. PDFs are now parsed from the uploaded bytes under a 45-second bound.

- **A confidence interval could be silently too narrow.** The Student-*t*
  critical value was found by bisection over a fixed `[0, 20]`, so any value
  above 20 came back as exactly 20 — `t(1)` at 99% is 63.657, making the
  interval about three times too narrow, in the direction that overstates how
  well the data pins the mean down. Latent (no route asks for a confidence other
  than 95%), but both `meanConfidenceInterval` and `welchMeanDifference` take it
  as an argument.

- **A binary fixture was corrupted by a Windows checkout.** `.gitattributes` had
  only `* text=auto`, whose binary detection is a NUL-byte scan of the first
  8 KB — which a small PDF can pass without containing one. Binary formats are
  now declared explicitly rather than left to that heuristic.

- **A column named `line` was thrown away.** `computeStats` skipped that name
  unconditionally, on the grounds that it is the synthetic row index the text
  parsers add — but those parsers report `isTabular: false` and their rows never
  reach the statistics engine, so the skip only ever hit a real column. Invoice
  line items, log line numbers, production line and line of business are all
  ordinary headers. Measured on one six-row CSV: `/analyze` listed the column and
  profiled it in the quality panel but had no statistics for it, so the two
  panels described different columns of the same file; choosing it as the target
  produced no evidence at all; and `/compare` returned **500**, because the
  comparison reads `baseline.stats[column].type` for every shared column.

- **A raw NUL byte in `public/app.js`.** The correlation matrix keys its `Map` on
  one column name, a NUL separator and the other, and that separator sat in the
  source as three literal `0x00` bytes rather than the escape that produces the
  same character. ripgrep stops at the first NUL and reports "binary file
  matches", so of the four `byPair` occurrences in the largest source file here,
  only the first was findable by search. Runtime behaviour was never affected;
  git was not either, which is why it survived.

### Changed

- CI runs on Node 22 and 24. Every job previously ran on Node 20, which
  `package.json` declares unsupported (`">=22"`); npm does not enforce `engines`,
  so CI passed on a runtime nothing here runs — not the container image
  (`node:24`), not the platform, not a developer's machine. A step now compares
  the running major against the `engines` field so the two cannot drift apart
  silently again.

- **The model is no longer sent the browser's drill-down data.** The prompt was
  built by stringifying the computed stats and correlations wholesale, so every
  field added for the UI became prompt content by accident — including
  `outliers.rows` (up to 200 flagged rows per numeric column) and each
  correlation's `scatter` (up to 500 paired observations). Measured on a
  20,000-row, 12-column file the prompt reached ~365,000 characters, roughly
  91,000 tokens, most of it serialised outlier rows, and it grew with the row
  count without a ceiling — on the visitor's own key. It is now ~63,700
  characters for the same file, and 5,000 rows and 20,000 rows cost about the
  same, because the size follows the column count instead. Nothing the model
  reasons about was removed: it keeps every count, fence, coefficient, `n`,
  coverage, caveat, histogram and frequency table, and gains `rowsReported`.

- **`docs/API.md` documents all 54 error codes**, grouped by where a failure
  comes from and with the status each returns. It previously listed 15, in a
  reference that opens by telling callers to match on `code`.

- The privacy documents describe what the server does now. README.md promised
  uploads are processed in memory while the PDF parser wrote them to disk, so
  PRIVACY.md and the privacy page carried a carve-out the README never mentioned.
  With the temporary file gone, all three say the same thing, and a test fails
  if any parser starts writing to disk again.

### Added

- **A standing check that file contents are rendered as text, not markup.**
  "Everything rendered goes through `esc()`" is a stated invariant of this
  project and nothing tested it. A browser journey now uploads a file whose every
  text field — column names, cell values, the filename — is an injection attempt,
  and asserts that nothing executes, no element is injected, and the text is
  still displayed. Both tests were verified by deleting the `esc()` on the path
  they cover, which fails them.

- Property-based tests over adversarially generated spreadsheets: 250 generated
  files per property plus 300 single-column cases, asserting what must hold for
  *any* input — a blank is never an observation, every cell lands in exactly one
  of missing/invalid/valid, summary statistics stay inside their own min and
  max, quantiles come out ordered, every value falls in exactly one histogram
  bin, a flagged outlier is really outside the fences, a coefficient is finite
  and within [-1, 1], provenance arithmetic adds up to the rows it read, and
  running the pipeline twice returns the same numbers. The generator is seeded
  and prints the seed and the failing file, so a break is reproducible. It found
  the `min`/`max` rounding defect above on seed 47.

- PDF parsing has tests: it previously had none at all — not the happy path, not
  a malformed file — on one of the file types the product advertises. Includes a
  regression test for a defect the new coverage exposed: pdf2json hands a Node
  `Buffer`'s underlying `ArrayBuffer` to pdfjs without carrying its pool
  `byteOffset` across, so it reads whatever else was in the pool and rejects a
  good PDF as having an invalid XRef header — a failure that depends on how much
  the process has already allocated, and so passes on a quiet run and appears
  under load.

### Verification

- 565 unit and API tests pass (`npm test`), up from 470 before this work.
- 80 of 80 Playwright journeys pass (`npm run test:browser`), desktop and a
  Pixel 5 viewport, up from 78. During an earlier run on a machine with ten
  other agent sessions live, the `/app` first-contentful-paint budget failed
  once at the end of a full 6-minute pass and then passed in seven consecutive
  isolated runs; the budget was not touched, and the final full run was green.
- `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities. No dependency was added, removed or upgraded.
- Every fix here was checked in both directions: the regression test was run
  against the previous code and observed to fail for the stated reason before
  being run against the fix.

### Known limitations

- 53 colour literals still sit outside `:root` in `public/styles.css`, against
  the project's own "CSS variables only" rule. They are shadows and translucent
  surfaces; converting them is a visual change and nothing in the suite renders
  pixels, so the count is now held under a ratchet
  (`tests/style-tokens.test.js`) rather than fixed.
- Type checking is not enforced. `checkJs` with `strict` reports 612 errors,
  almost all missing annotations rather than defects; without `strict` it
  reports 19, and the one real contract error it found — `inferStructure`
  documenting neither `unapplied` nor `warnings` — is fixed above. A gate would
  need the annotations first.
- Preview deployments sit behind Vercel Authentication, so the changes here were
  verified against a local server running the same entry point the serverless
  function loads (`api/index.js`), not against the preview URL over HTTP.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-17

### Security

- `nanoid` is bumped past GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 (infinite loop on a zero-size
  request) with a lockfile-only move to 3.3.18 — no override, and the
  "fail on high or critical" audit gate keeps its threshold. It reaches this
  repository only through the test toolchain (vitest → vite → postcss) and
  never ships in the serverless bundle.

### Added

- **The support behind every finding travels with the claim.** The Welch
  interval, Cohen's d, chi-square and p-value were computed for every
  qualifying finding and then buried inside the collapsed provenance
  drill-down, so the number's support never travelled with the number. The
  statistics line now renders beside the claim, and an unadjusted p-value
  says so where it appears rather than only in caveat prose. Numeric spread
  strips draw the computed 95% mean interval as a band around the mean dot
  and the IQR fences wherever a value sits beyond them — and a
  single-numeric-column file now gets its strip instead of none. When
  Pearson and Spearman disagree, the correlation's meta line carries both
  signed coefficients instead of only the leading one with a caveat naming a
  disagreement whose size stayed invisible.

- **"N values outside the fences" now answers "which rows".** The IQR fences
  already identified every row they flag; only the count and the fences
  reached the payload. The report now ships the flagged observations
  themselves — 1-based data-row number in the same row space evidence source
  rows use, the value, which fence was crossed and how far beyond — ordered
  by distance and capped at 200, with the count still the authority on how
  many exist. The column drill-down lists them farthest first, with the
  rule, the fence values and the sample size stated beside the list; fences
  from twelve or fewer values are called uncertain rather than presented as
  findings. No new statistic: this releases information the engine computed
  and discarded. The analysis schema moves to 2.10; a payload saved before
  it says its rows were counted but not kept — never an empty list, which
  would read as none found.

- **An overview that answers instead of summarising.** The summary tiles are
  replaced by a dashboard grid of self-contained computed answers: the file
  scorecard with how the file was read, quality including what could not be
  assessed, the target column's distribution with hollow outlier tails,
  findings by evidence family — a family the file cannot support says what
  it needed — the strongest findings with n, effect size and p inline,
  unsettled reads at the same visual weight as the settled cards, and the
  columns to fix first ranked by missingness. Zero findings, zero flagged
  columns and zero open questions all render as answers, never as absence.
  Each card headlines one numeral at about three times body size, pinned by
  a test. Two mark forms carry every composition: a stacked segment bar
  (filled for settled, hollow for what the engine could not settle, muted
  for measured absence — identity in the caption, never colour alone) and an
  axis-free sparkline with labelled endpoints; the file card uses both, its
  timeline drawn from the same gap-restored buckets as the trend chart.

- A performance budget runs as a blocking check. Each page has a ceiling on
  requests, transferred bytes and first contentful paint, plus an allowlist of
  the hosts it may contact — empty for `/`, `/docs` and `/privacy`, and the
  disclosed chart CDN for `/app`. The budgets are the measured cost plus about
  a third, so ordinary authoring does not trip them while a new library, an
  inlined asset or a reintroduced remote stylesheet does. A paint that never
  happens fails rather than being skipped, since that was the shape of the
  regression that prompted it. This is a budget expressed in Playwright, which
  already runs in CI, rather than Lighthouse: `@lhci/cli` pulls a high-severity
  advisory (`tmp <= 0.2.5`) into a repository whose CI fails on high, and the
  gate is worth more than the score.

- `RETENTION_DAYS` expires saved analyses after a configurable window. It is
  unset by default, so every existing deployment keeps the behaviour it has —
  an operator opts into expiry rather than having it applied to stored rows by
  an upgrade. The window is enforced when an analysis is *read*, not by a
  scheduled sweep, because a serverless deployment has nowhere to put a cron:
  an expired analysis stops being readable the moment it ages out rather than
  whenever a job next runs, and the filter sits inside the query, so a share
  link to an expired analysis answers exactly as a link to one that never
  existed. A save also clears that session's expired rows, which is
  housekeeping for storage size rather than the guarantee itself.

### Changed

- **The quality card stops manufacturing confidence.** The health ring's
  0–100 gauge and the B · 87/100 headline compressed genuine uncertainty
  into one number — the exact confidence this product exists to refuse. The
  overview's quality card now headlines the flagged-issue count over a
  severity-ordered segment bar in a single hue, with what the engine could
  not assess drawn hollow in the same bar; the grade and score remain in the
  full quality report and the top-bar chip. An untested evidence family
  draws the same track as a counted one, hollow, with what it needed
  beneath it, and the unsettled card gains a read ledger — every class of
  read the engine attempted, drawn as settled against open counts — so how
  unsettled a file is reads as a shape before any sentence is read.

- **Charts state their treatment of the tails and the gaps.** Histogram tail
  bins — everything beyond the IQR fences — draw transparent inside the
  accent border instead of masquerading as part of the central shape, and
  the chart's stated basis names the treatment. The trend chart and the
  inspector timeline merge the computed gap list back in as zero-count
  buckets and state how many were restored, so a month with no observations
  no longer looks identical to a month that never happened; a zero-count
  bucket draws no bar rather than a minimum-height one.

- **A distribution shift is drawn, not just scored.** Each shared numeric
  column in a two-file comparison draws both sides' five-number summaries as
  strips on one shared scale — baseline in the neutral tone, current in the
  accent — with the KS statistic and the Welch interval stated beside them
  and KS-significant columns first; the median delta, computed but never
  rendered, joins the change column. No shared numeric columns is stated as
  an answer.

- **The type faces are served from this origin.** They arrived through a
  render-blocking `@import` of fonts.googleapis.com in both stylesheets, so
  behind a proxy that drops the request rather than refusing it nothing
  painted at all — and every visitor handed Google an IP and User-Agent on
  every route, which the privacy page did not disclose. Twelve bundled woff2
  subsets (207 KB, DM Sans as a variable font) now serve under
  `font-src 'self'`, both Google hosts are gone from the CSP entirely so a
  stylesheet cannot reintroduce the dependency by asking, and first
  contentful paint drops from ~450 ms to ~105 ms on the landing page and
  ~730 ms to ~255 ms in the workspace.

- **An unsettled read explains itself unprompted.** When Ridge cannot settle
  a file's shape from the file alone, the provenance note now opens itself —
  the caveat and the rows it set aside no longer wait behind a collapsed
  summary line where the numbers above could be read as settled by anyone
  who did not think to expand it. A confident read stays folded as before.

- **A redesign pass moved the whole surface onto the Ridge visual system:**
  the analysis entry experience, navigation and AI settings, the progress
  display, and a decision-first results workspace with a persistent section
  nav, refined for small screens, with the landing page retold in the
  product's own vocabulary, a social preview card, and the last of the
  legacy DashboardX copy retired.

- A spreadsheet column with no header is now named for the column letter it
  occupies — `Column D` rather than SheetJS's internal `__EMPTY` handle, which
  produced quality issues reading `"__EMPTY" is completely empty` and named
  nothing a reader could find in their file. The rename happens at the parser
  boundary, so column selection, drill-downs, chart labels, the JSON export and
  evidence provenance all read the same name; renaming it where it is displayed
  would have made the exported name and the shown name disagree. A column
  genuinely called `Column D` keeps its name and the unnamed one steps aside,
  since merging two fields under one name would lose one of them silently.
  Duplicate headers are untouched and still get SheetJS's `a` / `a_1`.

### Fixed

- Entry animations ran for reduced-motion users again: removing a dead
  health-ring rule took the terminal selector of the reduced-motion block's
  selector list with it, so the `animation: none` declaration silently
  vanished. The declaration is restored on the surviving selectors; the
  existing reduced-motion journey caught it.

- A true Excel serial date is now read from the cell's number format and
  reported as the calendar day the workbook states. A spreadsheet date carries
  no timezone, but the reader converted SheetJS's local-time `Date` through
  `toISOString()`, which reinterpreted that instant as UTC and moved it across
  midnight: a cell holding serial 45292 formatted `mm/dd/yyyy` — 1 January 2024
  — was reported as `2023-12-31 20:00` anywhere east of UTC, and as a spurious
  datetime anywhere west of it. Only the hosted instance, which runs in UTC, was
  unaffected. The one fixture covering this wrote its cells through SheetJS on
  the same machine, which encodes the local offset into the serial and cancelled
  the error on the way back, so the pair agreed while both were wrong. The
  parser suite now reads the shape a real workbook stores — a plain serial plus
  a date format — and passes in UTC, New York, Kolkata, Los Angeles and
  Auckland. A bare number with no date format is still left alone: guessing a
  timeline from a value is how integer measurements get read as dates.

- The "Rows analyzed" tile printed a hardcoded "Full dataset", so a file whose
  title block and TOTAL row had been deliberately set aside still announced
  that every row counted — contradicting the provenance note rendered directly
  below it. The tile now counts the exclusions in the same words that note
  uses, so the headline and the audit trail underneath it cannot disagree.
- A request that never reached the server put the browser's own wording in the
  error box — "Failed to fetch" in Chrome, "Load failed" in Safari. Neither
  names a cause nor suggests an action, and a reader could not tell whether
  Ridge had broken or their connection had. All six request paths now explain
  that case themselves; anything the server wrote still passes through
  untouched.
- Every unreadable response from the analyze endpoint was suffixed with "the
  upload may be too large", so a 17 KB file meeting a 500 was told to shrink,
  contradicting the readiness line that had just measured it. The size hint now
  appears only on 413, the status that actually means it.
- The keyless "Add API key to explain" button set the settings panel's display
  directly, so the panel opened while the control that owns it still reported
  `aria-expanded="false"`, and focus stayed at the foot of the results instead
  of moving to the key field. Both entry points now share one open path.
- Only `/app` carried a skip link, so a keyboard visitor landing on `/`,
  `/docs` or `/privacy` had to walk the whole navigation before reaching the
  content. All four routes now have one.
- The tier toggles, the tier jump buttons and the setup-rail toggle were never
  added to the coarse-pointer block that holds every other control to 44px, and
  stayed near 27px. Those are the controls a phone visitor hits first, since
  the rest of the results screen sits collapsed behind them.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- The release workflow's notes extraction treated the version heading's
  brackets as a regex character class, so `## [2.2.0]` never matched and the
  publish step failed after every verification passed — which is why v2.2.0
  carries green checks but no GitHub Release. The heading is now matched
  literally. No product change; the v2.2.0 tag stays as it is, per the
  append-only release policy.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-08-07

### Security

- `pdfjs-dist` is overridden to 6.2.108, past GHSA-hq66-cqwq-w95j (arbitrary
  JavaScript execution on opening a malicious PDF). The vulnerable copy was a
  transitive dependency of `officeparser`, whose PDF path Ridge never calls —
  PDFs go through `pdf2json` — so the override carries no behaviour change for
  any file Ridge parses; the office-document tests pin that.

### Added

- A skip link past the top bar for keyboard users, and an accessible name on
  every chart canvas carrying the chart's title and its evidence line, so a
  screen reader hears what the chart claims and on what support.

- **A chart for every column the engine computed an aggregate for.** The chart
  grid used to stop at one chart per kind and three in total, which read as
  "these three columns matter" when it meant "the renderer stopped". Every
  column with a full-file aggregate now gets its chart — histograms for
  numeric fields, frequency bars for true categories, bucketed trends for
  dates — with the target column first. Wide files stop at twelve cards behind
  a note naming exactly what was held back and where the rest lives; columns
  without a chartable aggregate still produce nothing, because a filler chart
  is decoration, not evidence.
- **The pairing behind every reported correlation, drawn.** Each correlation
  carries `scatter` (payload schema 2.9): the pairwise-complete observations
  verbatim up to 500 pairs, a 20×20 density grid above that, in which every
  pair lands in exactly one cell. The workspace plots it under the
  coefficient. Built from the same pairwise filtering as the number, so the
  plot and the coefficient can never describe different observations; older
  saved analyses carry no pairs and their numbers stand alone.
- **A correlation matrix** over every numeric column pair when a file has
  three or more — blue for pairs rising together, red for pairs moving apart,
  the coefficient printed in every tinted cell so colour never carries the
  value alone. An unreported pair is a dot with the reason on hover: below
  the reporting bar is a different statement from a measured zero.
- **Numeric spread strips.** The Statistical Summary opens with a strip per
  numeric column — 5th–95th percentile line, middle-50% box, median tick,
  mean dot, IQR-fence outlier count — each on its own stated scale.
- **Per-column completeness tracks** in the quality card: valid, missing and
  unparseable drawn as a stacked bar in the status colours, with the counts
  in text and on hover, replacing the compressed `12%∅` chips.
- **A health ring and completeness meter** in the decision snapshot, beside
  their numbers, never instead of them.
- **Any chart downloads as a PNG**, composited onto an opaque surface so it
  survives dark viewers, named after the dataset and the chart.
- **A possibly transposed sheet is declared, not read in silence.** When
  magnitudes agree within each row and span orders of magnitude within each
  column — the condition under which a column mean averages unrelated
  measures — the reading is reported `uncertain` with a warning saying what
  would go wrong and that the columns were computed as-is (structure report
  1.1.0, additive `warnings`). A same-scale transposition still passes, as
  the deliberate limit it is: it is statistically indistinguishable from an
  ordinary table and its means are not nonsense.
- **The workspace leads with the sample path.** A first-visit strip offering
  the finished sample analysis sits above the dropzone; the link, focus and
  save controls share one "Refine the run · all optional" group; the health
  grade and evidence count ride in the dashboard top bar, computed.
- **The landing hero speaks the product's own vocabulary.** The computed-output
  demo now carries a miniature spread strip and an evidence line quoting the
  sample dataset's real correlation with its sample size and coverage — the
  workspace's visual language in preview, not marketing numbers.

### Changed

- Charts are built the first time their canvas nears the viewport instead of
  all at once at render — tier ③ arrives collapsed, and a wide file now
  produces a chart per column.
- Chart colours come from the design tokens at render time. Every Chart.js
  config carried string literals from the pre-Ridge palette, so the rebrand
  that moved every token never reached the charts; a source-level test keeps
  the drifted literals from returning.

- An empty evidence panel is explained rather than removed. When no finding
  cleared the reporting thresholds — which an ordinary small file routinely does
  not — the Evidence panel, the headline of tier ① *What we found*, set itself to
  `display: none` and disappeared without a word. A first-time reader could not
  tell "Ridge found nothing worth claiming" from "Ridge is broken" or "I uploaded
  it wrong". It now states that nothing qualified, why that happens, and that the
  statistics and quality diagnostics below were still computed in full.
  Non-tabular files stay hidden: evidence was never computed for them, so
  reporting that nothing qualified would describe a test that never ran.
- A file read without incident now says so. The structure note was hidden
  whenever nothing unusual was found, which made a file Ridge had checked look
  exactly like a file Ridge had never checked — withholding the one fact the
  reader needed, that the question was asked at all. A clean read now shows a
  quiet dashed confirmation (`Read as-is · header on row 1 · 4 observations`)
  that expands to say what was looked for and not found. Analyses saved before
  structural inference still show nothing, because for those the question really
  was never asked.
- An `includeRows` correction that matches no exclusion is no longer a silent
  no-op. It is reported in `meta.structure.unapplied` with the reason — outside
  the file, at or above the header row, or simply not an excluded row — shown in
  the workspace and the printable report, and it makes the reading `uncertain`,
  because the caller is working from a picture of the file that this one
  contradicts. It is reported rather than raised as an error: the request is well
  formed, and failing the whole analysis would make corrections brittle, since
  changing the header row restates every row number in the file.
- A trailing row labelled `Total` whose numbers do not add up is now reported as
  an **uncertain** exclusion rather than a confident one. Arithmetic is the
  evidence; the label is a naming convention, and "Total" is a legitimate final
  category in real files. The row is still excluded — the asymmetry that governs
  exclusions has not changed — but it is excluded as an open question. Trailing
  arithmetic that carries no label is unaffected and still settles the question
  on its own.

### Fixed

- Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, the result tiers kept the opacity-0 starting
  state their entry animation was meant to animate away from — reduced-motion
  users met blank space where the results were. The tiles now render visible
  with motion off.
- A second table sharing a sheet no longer merges into the first in silence. Two
  tables separated by blank rows were read as one: the second table's header
  became an observation and its values joined the first table's statistics,
  under a reading that reported nothing unusual. The second header is now
  detected — it follows a gap, is entirely text, and has numbers beneath it —
  excluded as the header it is, and the reading is reported `uncertain` naming
  the row where the second table starts. Splitting the two into separate
  analyses is deliberately not attempted: deciding which table was meant would
  be a guess, and the rows below are still counted with the first table's.
- **Numbers written in a spreadsheet's own notation are numbers again.**
  `$48,000`, `12.5%`, `1,200` and the accounting `(1,200)` all read as
  non-numeric, so a currency or percentage column was typed categorical and
  produced no statistics whatsoever — or, worse, kept only the cells that
  happened to parse: a column of `1,200 / 950 / 1,400 / 880` reported a mean of
  915, computed from the two values without separators and presented as if it
  described the column. All four notations now parse, and a numeric column
  carries `formats` naming the conventions it was read through, shown in the
  column inspector and the printable report. Two limits are deliberate: a
  percentage reads at the magnitude the cell displays (`12.5%` is 12.5, not
  0.125), and European decimal notation is left unparsed rather than guessed at,
  since `1.234,56` is 1234.56 in much of the world and 1.234 in the rest.
- A title row wide enough to look like a header no longer passes undetected.
  "Q3 Report" in A1 with a date in C1 reaches all three columns, so the span
  test alone could not tell it from the header beneath it, and it was taken as
  the header in silence. Such a row does not *fill* the block, and scores worse
  on the header signals than the row below it; where a later candidate beats a
  sparse first choice, that candidate is preferred and the reading is reported
  as uncertain, with the title offered back as an alternative and excluded as
  preamble rather than quietly becoming the column names.
- **Spreadsheets are read for their shape before anything is computed.** Parsing
  took row 1 as the header and every other row as an observation. On an ordinary
  corporate export — a title in A1, the real header on row 3, a `TOTAL` row at
  the bottom — that produced column names like `__EMPTY`, counted the header as
  data, and folded the total row into the statistics: a mean 60% above the truth,
  reported at 100% coverage, with the total row not even flagged as an outlier.
  Structural inference now locates the header by how far the row reaches across
  the data block, and excludes rows that restate the rows above them, detected by
  label and by column-wise arithmetic. Arithmetic is what catches an *unlabelled*
  total, which no keyword list would.

### Added

- A structure report on every analysis: the header row, the observation count,
  and every row set aside with the reason it was. It travels in `meta.structure`
  through the API response, the saved payload, the JSON export and the printable
  report, and is stated above the findings in the workspace, because it qualifies
  every number below it. When inference cannot settle a reading it says so
  prominently rather than committing quietly — and still excludes what it is
  unsure of, since wrongly keeping an aggregate corrupts every statistic while
  reporting full coverage, whereas wrongly dropping an observation costs one row
  and announces itself.
- Structural corrections: `headerRow` says where the header really is and
  `includeRows` puts an excluded row back. Both re-submit the file rather than
  editing a stored result, and a restored row moves to `structure.restored`
  rather than vanishing — overriding the engine must not make a result less
  auditable than trusting it.
- Column selection: exclude ID, free-text or otherwise irrelevant fields before
  anything is computed, so they stop polluting correlations and evidence. Rows
  are never filtered — excluding a column removes a measurement, not an
  observation. Selections are sent as JSON arrays, never delimited strings,
  because real headers contain commas.
- An analysis workspace: a setup rail holding the source, the target column,
  the column selection and the re-run control, beside the results canvas.
  Setup changes are staged rather than fired on change, and until the analysis
  re-runs the results are marked stale by a filled re-run button counting the
  pending edits, a banner above the findings and a rule across the canvas.
- Full-file deterministic charts for numeric distributions, categorical
  frequencies, and date trends. Charts now work without AI and cover the same
  rows as the reported statistics.
- Traceable analysis records with request ID, completion time, processing
  duration, engine/schema versions, AI participation, and retention status.
  JSON errors carry the same request ID as the `X-Request-ID` response header.
- Production OCI packaging: a non-root Node 24 image, HTTP health check,
  graceful shutdown, secret-safe build context, and a private-deployment
  runbook with explicit scaling limits.
- One-click sample analysis from the landing page.
- Deterministic two-file comparison mode with baseline/current semantics,
  schema drift, quality movement, row and column deltas, and exportable shared
  column changes. Comparison works without an API key.
- Evidence provenance drill-downs with the exact formula, inclusion rule,
  excluded-row accounting, and bounded source-row excerpts containing only the
  columns used by each finding.
- Deterministic inference: 95% t intervals for numeric means, Welch intervals
  and p-values for group/file mean differences, chi-square with Cramér's V for
  categorical associations, two-sample KS distribution-shift tests, and an
  explicitly exploratory median/MAD level-shift detector for dated targets.
- A five-user pilot playbook, privacy-safe structured feedback issue form, and
  in-product pilot feedback links so validation measures observed reuse instead
  of collecting vague interest.

### Changed

- Results are organised into four ranked tiers — what we found, how we know,
  the data, interpretation — replacing twelve equally-weighted cards that gave
  the reader no way to tell what mattered. All model output is now contiguous
  in the last tier instead of interleaved with computed output.
- Provenance is a closed vocabulary: **Computed** is measured from the file,
  **Derived** is calculated from those measurements, **Written** is model prose
  quoting them. This replaces the `ai-badge` class, which carried four
  different meanings — two of them the opposite of its name. A stamp appears on
  a tier header, and on a claim only when it differs from its tier. The printed
  report uses the same three words.
- Interpretation renders on a distinct dark surface so model prose reads as a
  different substance before a word is parsed; the printed form carries the
  same boundary with a rule, since printers drop backgrounds.
- Evidence and correlations share one claim-strength scale with the underlying
  number alongside. The data-quality grade stays visually distinct: it measures
  the input, not confidence in a claim.
- `ANALYSIS_SCHEMA_VERSION` is 2.6: `meta.activeColumns` and
  `meta.excludedColumns` record what an analysis was computed over. Both are
  optional, and their absence means every column was included.
- Repositioned the landing page around defensible spreadsheet answers for
  finance, operations, and analytics teams, with hosted and self-hosted paths.
- Raised the supported Node.js floor to Node 22; the production container uses
  the current Node 24 LTS line.
- Analysis schema version is now `2.5`, evidence engine `1.1.0`, and comparison
  engine `1.1.0`; inference results and row-level provenance are exportable.

### Fixed

- Text colours now meet WCAG AA (4.5:1) on every surface they appear on. The
  tertiary text tone measured 3.84:1 across 57 rules, and the semantic colours
  were worse — amber at 2.87:1, green at 2.96:1 — because nothing measured
  them. The landing page carried the same two defects in its parallel palette.
  Tokens were darkened rather than the rules edited, and `tests/contrast.test.js`
  now fails the build if any pairing drops below AA.
- HTTPS URL analysis no longer incorrectly requires an Anthropic key. The
  deterministic path works for URL inputs exactly as it does for uploads.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-30

The product-wide Ridge rebrand release. The product is now the deterministic evidence
engine; AI interpretation is an optional layer over it.

### Added

- **Evidence Mode.** Every material finding is a structured object carrying
  `claim`, `metric`, `value`, `columns`, `method`, `sampleSize`, `coverage`,
  `strength`, `caveat` and `engineVersion`. An optional **target column**
  focuses the engine on one outcome: group comparisons with a standardized
  effect size, target correlations, missingness impact, and trends over time.
- **Analysis without an API key.** Parsing, statistics, quality profiling,
  correlations and evidence all run server-side with no model involved.
  Responses report `meta.aiIncluded`.
- **`POST /api/explain`** adds AI interpretation to results already computed, so
  a keyless analysis can be explained without re-uploading.
- **Spearman correlation** alongside Pearson, with averaged tie ranks.
- **Date profiling**: valid/invalid counts, range, bucketed trend,
  period-over-period change, gaps and irregular-interval detection.
- **Representative sampling** — a bounded, deterministic cross-section
  (boundaries, quantiles, rows with missing values, outliers, category
  examples, chronological edges), each row labelled with why it was chosen.
- **Exports**: JSON, and a printable HTML report that labels every section as
  deterministic or AI-generated and carries the schema and engine versions.
- **Try sample data** — a bundled 91-row dataset so a first visit needs no
  upload and no key.
- **Deleting a saved analysis** (`DELETE /api/history/:id`), scoped to the
  session that saved it.
- `/about`, `/privacy` and `/docs` pages; `PRIVACY.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `docs/API.md` and `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- Configurable rate limits via `RATE_LIMIT_POINTS` and `RATE_LIMIT_ASK_POINTS`.

### Changed

- **The root URL is now the application**, not a marketing page. The former
  landing page moved to `/about`; `/app` redirects to `/` preserving the query
  string, so existing shared links keep working.
- **Persistence is opt-in per analysis** and off by default. A configured
  Supabase no longer causes every successful analysis to be stored.
- **API keys default to session storage**, cleared with the tab, with an
  explicit *Remember this key on this device* opt-in for local storage. The
  wording now states plainly that the key is sent to the backend and forwarded
  to Anthropic per request, rather than claiming it never leaves the browser.
- Default model is **Claude Sonnet 5** (balanced); the picker labels each model
  by capability, speed and cost.
- Correlations report the method that actually characterises the pair, choosing
  Spearman when it exceeds Pearson by the same margin that triggers the
  non-linearity caveat.
- Categorical `top` values are `{ value, count, percentage }` objects.
- The analysis prompt receives computed evidence and a labelled representative
  sample, and is instructed to explain rather than rediscover, to carry caveats
  forward, and to label any offered explanation as a hypothesis.

### Fixed

- **Missing values no longer become zeroes.** `Number(null)`, `Number("")` and
  `Number("   ")` all return `0`, so blank cells were entering means, medians
  and correlations as real observations. All numeric reads now go through a
  shared coercion that returns null for absence and preserves a genuine zero,
  and correlations filter pairwise before computing.
- **Categorical `top` values are ranked by frequency**, not first appearance.
  The previous implementation used `Set` insertion order and presented whichever
  value happened to appear first as the most common.
- Correlations no longer report `r=0` for a constant series; the pair is omitted
  rather than implying "measured, found nothing".
- Distribution evidence is bounded by coverage: a 93%-empty column can no longer
  yield a "strong" finding from a handful of values.
- Numeric fields expose `invalid` and `coverage`, so a half-unparseable column
  can no longer pass as clean numeric data.
- Aggregate upload size is enforced server-side. Ten 4 MB files previously
  passed per-file validation and then failed at Vercel's request limit with an
  opaque error; they now return `413 upload_too_large`.
- Multi-file "success" means "parsed", so keyless batches report accurate counts
  and skip cross-file synthesis instead of failing.

### Migration

- Browser storage keys `dx_api_key`, `dx_model` and `dx_session` migrate once to
  `ridge_api_key`, `ridge_model` and `ridge_session`, in whichever store held
  them. An existing value under the new name is never overwritten; the migration
  is idempotent and survives a storage that throws. The session header is now
  `x-ridge-session`.
- Saved analyses created before this release still open. The dashboard reads
  both the current correlation shape and the legacy `colA`/`colB`/`r` fields.
- `/app` links redirect to `/`.

### Verification

249 unit and API integration tests, plus 24 Playwright journeys across desktop
and a Pixel 5 viewport. The Anthropic SDK is mocked throughout; no test requires
a key or makes a provider call.

### Known limitations

- Group comparisons use a standardized mean difference; no significance test or
  confidence interval is reported yet.
- Date parsing is pattern-gated and does not interpret Excel serial numbers as
  dates.
- Charts are rendered client-side from up to 100 sample rows, so they visualise
  a slice while the statistics above them cover the whole file.
- Saved analyses have no automatic expiry.
